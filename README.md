Slides and materials for the "Teaching Data Science at All Levels" invited session at ENAR 2018

Chair: Lance Waller, Emory University

## Talks

- [Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel](@mine-cetinkaya-rundel) (Duke + RStudio) - Data Science as a Gateway to Statistics - [Slides]()

In this talk we will discuss a data science course designed to
serve as a gateway to the discipline of statistics, the statistics
major, and broadly to quantitative studies. The course is
intended for an audience of Duke University students with little
to no computing or statistical background, and focuses on
data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization,
and effective communication. Unlike most traditional introductory
statistics courses, this course approaches statistics
from a model-based perspective and introduces simulation-based
and Bayesian inference later in the course. A heavy
emphasis is placed on reproducibility (with R Markdown) and
version control and collaboration (with git/GitHub). In this
talk we will discuss in detail the course structure, logistics,
and pedagogical considerations as well as give examples
from the case studies used in the course. We will also share
student feedback, assessment of the success of the course
in recruiting students to the statistical science major, and
our experience of growing the course from a small seminar
course for first-year undergraduates to a larger course open to
the entire undergraduate student body.

- Michael I. Love (UNC) - Teaching Data Science for Life Sciences - [Slides](https://goo.gl/5s2HXL)

Biologists and biomedical researchers find their fields have
rapidly advanced toward a state where experiments produce
large data outputs they are not formally trained to evaluate.
These large datasets must be processed, normalized and
appropriately modeled before making scientific inferences.
I will discuss various forums through which biologists and 
biomedical researches are updating their data science skills
for working with and publishing on these data, and what
informs their choice between collaborating with quantitative
researchers and developing data science skills within
the “wet lab”. I will also discuss considerations regarding
statistical content of short courses and MOOCs available
to these scientists to augment their data analytic skills for
modern datasets

- Garrett Grolemund - Make Interactive Web Tutorials with learnr and R - [Slides & demo](https://vimeo.com/261761874)

The learnr R package provides a new multimedia approach
for teaching statistics and programming with R. With learnr,
teachers can combine text, diagrams, videos, pacing cues,
code exercises, multiple choice questions, automated
grading software and more to create an interactive, selfpaced
tutorial. Learnr is based on the familiar R Markdown
format, which makes it easy to write learnr tutorials and
to host them online. This talk will demonstrate the learnr
package and examine several best practices for teaching in
a multi-media, self paced format format, a format that may
be new to many teachers.

- Frauke Kreuter (University of Maryland + University of Mannheim) - Teaching Survey and Data Science Outside Regular Classroom Settings - [Slides](/slides/Kreuter_ENAR_03252018.pdf)

Over the last three years we experimented with various
events and teaching activities to bring non-STEM students
and practitioners up to speed on Survey and Data
Science. This talk will highlight three approaches. First, the
DataFest, a Data Analysis challenge designed for students
to learn and apply data analysis skills during a weekend
to create insights out of novel data. Second, the Advanced
Data Analytics training provides training in Data Science 
for federal, state and local government program agency
employees [coleridgeinitiative.org](http://coleridgeinitiative.org/). Third, an
International Professional Training Program in Survey and
Data Science [survey-data-science.net](http://survey-data-science.net/). In all
instances the the majority of the participants are neither
computer scientists nor do they have any extensive training
in statistics. We found the task-oriented approach with
strong peer-to-peer elements to show remarkable successes
in brining non-technical people of all ages into a situation
where they can critically analyze complex data, and learn
how to self-enhance their skillset.
